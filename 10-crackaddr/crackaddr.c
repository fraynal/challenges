        Static analysis challenge: Dealing with the implicit state machine
        
        These two files (simple_example_good.c, simple_example_bad.c) are 
        designed to illustrate a particular shortcoming of code analysis tools
        as they exist today: The neglect of the existence of implicit state
        machines and their effect.
        
        The code is loosely inspired by the crackaddr() overflow that Mark
        Dowd found in Sendmail in March 2003. It is also related to the 
        prescan()-bugs that Michal Zalewski found in the same year.
        
        The code contains an implicit state machine with the following 
        states:
        
                1. quotation = roundquote = false
                2. quotation = true, roundquote = false
                3. quotation = false, roundquote = true
                4. quotation = true, roundquote = true
                
        The following transitions are possible (hope I didn't miss any):
                1->2, 1->3, 2->1, 3->1, 3->4, 4->3
        
        The "bad" variant of this file contains the problem that the trans-
        ition 1->3 fails to decrement "upperlimit". An attacker can, by repeat-
        edly cycling through this state transition (for example by issuing an 
        input string of "()()()()...", move the upperlimit variable to point
        behind the end of localbuf. In order to reach this state, at least 10
        iterations are required, though.
        
        This code is difficult to analyze automatically for the following 
        reasons:
        
        1) The behavior of the loop is dependent on previous iterations, and
        in a way that leads to overapproximation in most abstract inter-
        pretation frameworks. This overapproximation (due to not really taking
        into account the implicit state machine) makes it difficult to tell 
        the "good" case from the "bad" case.
        
        2) The loop body itself has at least 8 different paths that can be
        taken on each iteration ('<', '>', '(', ')', upperlimit reached or
        not). In order to get to an invalid state, at least 9 iterations of
        the loop are required. A (completely incorrect, but nonetheless 
        insight-generating) calculation gets us to 2^3^9 = 2^27 states,
        sufficient to thwart a naive "let's explore all possible paths" 
        approach. 
        
        Long story short: I believe that these two files summarize well some
        of the reasons why code analysis tools are not very good at finding
        sophisticated bugs with a very low false positive rate. If you have
        any automated code analysis that detects the issue in the bad example
        and does not detect the issue in the good example, I'd be excited to
        hear from you :-) thomas.dullien@zynamics.com
